# Salary-Prediction

<br> To improve my data science skill, I decided to enroll myself in Python-Data Science Workshop held by Sanbercode for free. It lasted for an intensive four weeks with daily materials and assignments. To complete the workshop and assess our knowledge of data preprocessing during this workshop, we had a final project on Kaggle, and it ran for three days. In terms of privacy, I didn't share the dataset.
<br> This project aims to predict whether someone's salary is greater than (or equal to) 7 million Rupiah based on any descriptions given on the dataset. In this project, I learned a lot about how to track and handle missing data and how to normalize dataset. I also performed many machine learning algorithms to select which one produces the best performance for the problem. This project used ROC-AUC scoring metrics to evaluate our built model. Based on the final leaderboard, I was ranked 67th with an accuracy score of 0.88 (the top participant scores 0.95).
